> When NFS is enabled, this Tunable may be used to alleviate or solve instances of "NFS Stale File Handles"
> you might encounter with your NFS client.
> 
> In essence, (fuse_remember) tells an internal subsystem (named "fuse") how long to "remember" or "cache"
> file and directory information associated with user shares.  When an NFS client attempts to access a file
> (or directory) on the server, and that file (or directory) name is not cached, then you could encounter
> "stale file handle".
> 
> The numeric value of this tunable is the number of seconds to cache file/directory name entries,
> where the default value of 330 indicates 5 1/2 minutes.  There are two special values you may also set
> this to:
> 
> * 0 which means, do not cache file/directory names at all, and
> * -1 which means cache file/directory names forever (or until array is stopped)
> 
> A value of 0 would be appropriate if you are enabling NFS but only plan to use it for disk shares,
> not user shares.
> 
> A value of -1 would be appropriate if no other timeout seems to solve the "stale file handle" on
> your client.  Be aware that setting a value of -1 will cause the memory footprint to grow by approximatel
> 108 bytes per file/directory name cached.  Depending how much RAM is installed in your server and how many
> files/directories you access via NFS this may or may not lead to out-of-memory conditions.
